# Polynomials 0.2

Support of Polynomial of degrees up to 100. Supports root-finding, derivative and more.

Also includes an app which supports plotting, roots finding, factorisation and derivatives

Rational functions are also supported

Plotting requires that matplotlib and numpy are installed.

The app requires PyQT4

Features:

* Roots
* Nth derivative
* Tangents
* Inflection points and inflection tangents
* Plotting
* Factorisation
* Addition and subtraction
* Multiplication and division (including polynomial division)
* Power to positive integers
* Extremes
* Limit
* Integrals
* Rational functions
* Asymptotes
